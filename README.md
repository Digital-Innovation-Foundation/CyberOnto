# CyberOnto and CyberSA

Cybersecurity Ontology (CyberOnto) and Situational Awareness (CyberSA) help teamwork in Cyber Incident Responses, Control, Containment, and Countermeasures (CIRC3). We integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Knowledge Graph (KG) technologies to automate CyberSA capabilities. 

## Definitions

CyberSA has become a reliable practice to optimize CyberOps (Onwubiko, 2020). It helps define the frameworks for complex team-based tasks of "gathering information, perceiving and understanding the state of the world, and predicting states of the world forward in time." (Gutzwiller et al., 2020).

As per this recent study "research and our additional professional field observations in government, industry, and academia suggest that the utility of SA analysis and measurement has yet to be realized in cyberspace". 

## Objectives

This research project, linked to a new product development initiative, aims to build a CyberSA measurement method that could help cybersecurity response teams cope with complexity of fast-paced attacks-defense scenarios.

To build this measurement method, we will use an existing cybersecurity ontology, serving as the source of best practices in our Artificial Intelligence (AI) architecture. Cyber Ontologies have been demonstrated to offer reliable CyberOps automation (Syed, 2020; Alenezi, et al., 2020).

We propose to use a recent Knowledge Graph (KG) and ontology by MITRE integrating the ATT&CK and D3FEND frameworks (Kaloroumakis and Smith, 2021). This new free, open-source asset goes beyond recent advances in intelligent CyberSA (Liu, et al., 2022).

By extending this open source ontology, we will  develop semantic reasoning testing CyberSA capabilities in actual scenarios of Cyber Incident Responses, Control, Containment, and Countermeasures (CIRC3). It will be open-source and attempt to integrate with other initiatives in cybersecurity ontology-driven automation (Grigoriadis, et al., 2022). It can also integrate with ontologies aimed at defining cybersecurity knowledge domains and applications, where CIRC3 team members can be actively integrated as "automation with humans in the loop", liking people's skills and competencies directly to CyberSA capabilities (Léger, 2021). It should also help enable AI-powered cyber defense, which depends on fast and dynamic team learning and knowledge distribution across warfare units (Chen, 2021).

## Methodology

The countermeasures recommended by the semantic reasoning queries will serve as an optimal gold standard representing the best practice. We will then compare  the actual CIRC3 tasks and actions by the team, helping to measure the degree of departure from protocol.

Hence, the higher the proximity of team practice to protocol, the higher CyberSA should implicitely be. It will be measured using traditional metrics in KG proximity among nodes and links. Also, the tool will be tested for accuracy, with AI techniques being added to improve its performance. Metrics will include F1 measure and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to evaluate the quality of our ontology inference capabilities. 

The results of this research could serve cybersecurity team leadership with more attention to how CyberSA impacts the quality of threat response. It may become a valuable asset to integrate with other open source CyberSA solutions, helping to support teamwork effectiveness (Husák, et al., 2022).
